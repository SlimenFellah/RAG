# RAG Systems Exploration

This repository documents my journey in building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, starting from simple implementations and progressing to more complex architectures. The goal is to experiment, learn, and share insights about RAG techniques and their applications.

## Contents

- Step-by-step RAG system implementations
- Explanations and documentation for each stage
- Example use cases and experiments

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in each section to explore different RAG setups.

## About

This repo is intended for learning and experimentation with RAG systems, showcasing the evolution from basic to advanced solutions.
